handpunch try to implement some basic functionality for HandKey and HandPunch
 devices agree to the protocol specification binded by the manufacturer in
 http://www.handpunch.com/manuals/Hand_Reader_Technical_Manual_2.7.pdf .


COMPATIBLES DEVICE 
------------------
 I have tested handpunch with HandPunch 3000, and Hand Key2000 units, and i 
  think it is compatible with units Handpunch 1000, and Handpunch 2000 agree
  the manufacturer specification.
 For units HandPunch 4000, this softwre requires some modifications.

BUILD
-----
  Uncompress and compile using make
   $ tar -zxf handpunch.x.tgz
   $ cd handpunch-*
   $ make

BASIC USAGE
-----------
 * Use the unit for staff enrollment.
 * Howto specify connection type, and unit ID.
  _You will need specify the connection type with -u argumment.
    For serial connection in port /dev/ttyS0, using 9600 bauds, you can use:
     $ handpunch -u /dev/ttyS0:9600 

    For ethernet connection in 192.168.1.10, port 3001, you can use:
     $ handpunch -u 192.168.1.10:3001
    Bauds, and port are optionall, and default value are 9600, and 3001 respectively.

  _You will need specify the unit ID with -n argumment.
    If you unknown the unit ID, you can scan some numbers with -s action argument:
     $ handpunch -u 192.168.1.10:3001 -s 
     > Unit number found: 1. Now try use me whith:   -n 1

 * Then do some basic queries to the unit.
    Query reader info :
     $ handpunch -u 192.168.1.10:3001 -n1 -qi
    Query unit time (view format time in FAQ):
     $ handpunch -u 192.168.1.10:3001 -n1 -qt
    Download user attendance transactions(view record format in FAQ).
     $ handpunch -u 192.168.1.10:3001 -n1 -di

 * Cron unit time updates
     $ handpunch -u 192.168.1.10:3001 -n1 -ct

 * Cron fingerprints backup
     $ handpunch -u 192.168.1.10:3001 -n1 -ql > backup

   

FAQ
---
 1) Why -mc option for avoid CRC check on responses?
 2) Why -mw option for avoid wakeup tries before operations?
 3) What is the used format time?
 4) What is the record format when download user attendance transactions?

 1) Why -mc option for avoid CRC check on responses?
    -----------------------------------------------
    In my experience, a query for bank memory on HandkeyII unit, return crc 
     error, with valid data. Yes.. a problem, but this option existis because
     the return data are ok.
    Query for enrolled users, uses this bank memory query.


 2) Why -mw option for avoid wakeup tries before operations?
    -------------------------------------------------------
    HandPunch units normally remain in a resting state. In this state do not
     respond to any command except the command for awakening. 
    Awake command is sent before each operation with the unit except that this
     option is enabled.

 3) What is the used format time?
    ----------------------------
    Times are specified in format:
     YYYY.MM.DD HH.MM.SS

 4) What is the record format when download user attendance transactions?
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    Format:
     YYYY.MM.DD HH.MM.SS IIIIIIIIII
    Where IIIIIIIIII user ID with leading zeros.
